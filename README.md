# The Free Publishing License(FPL)
## What is the Free Publishing License?‌
The **Free Publishing License** is a template for dedicating software to the public domain. 

It allows anyone to use, modify, and distribute the software in source or binary form for any purpose, without conditions. 

In other words, it shows that you have released the code to the *public domain*.
## Why Use the Free Publishing License?‌
Because legal complexities should never hinder creativity or collaboration. 

How often have you avoided using a valuable tool due to licensing conflicts? How much time have lost debating compatibility issues or fearing legal repercussions? This license eliminates those barriers by placing your work squarely in the public domain. 

Focus on what matters--building, sharing, and innovating--while leaving bureaucratic overhead behind.
